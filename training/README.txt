This part tires to generate weights for each part of the evaluation function (e.g. factor for a horizontal vs vertical line)
Therefore a bot with intial weights of 1 starts playing vs a mutated copy of itself for a given amount of rounds.
If the mutated bot wins, it becomes the new champ and makes a mutated copy of itself.
The champ always begins the game, as this is a much powerful position. Thus, the champ only loses, if a much more powerful bot was generated.
